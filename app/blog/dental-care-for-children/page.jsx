    <p>Establishing good oral health habits early in life sets the foundation for a lifetime of healthy smiles. As a parent, you play a crucial role in your child's dental health journey. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate every stage of your child's oral development.</p>

    <h2>Infant Oral Care (0-12 months)</h2>
    
    <h3>Before the First Tooth</h3>
    <p>Even before teeth appear, oral care is important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clean gums daily:</strong> Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe your baby's gums</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid bottle propping:</strong> Don't let your baby fall asleep with a bottle</li>
      <li><strong>Limit sugary drinks:</strong> Stick to breast milk, formula, or water</li>
      <li><strong>Start good habits:</strong> Make oral care part of the daily routine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>First Teeth (6-12 months)</h3>
    <p>When the first tooth appears:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a soft-bristled infant toothbrush</li>
      <li>Brush with water or a tiny amount of fluoride toothpaste</li>
      <li>Schedule the first dental visit by age 1</li>
      <li>Watch for signs of teething discomfort</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Toddler Dental Care (1-3 years)</h2>
    
    <h3>Establishing Routines</h3>
    <p>This is the time to build lasting habits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brush twice daily:</strong> Morning and before bed</li>
      <li><strong>Use fluoride toothpaste:</strong> Rice grain-sized amount for children under 3</li>
      <li><strong>Make it fun:</strong> Use colorful toothbrushes and sing songs</li>
      <li><strong>Supervise brushing:</strong> Children need help until age 6-8</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
    <p>What your toddler eats affects their teeth:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limit sugary snacks and drinks</li>
      <li>Offer water between meals</li>
      <li>Choose healthy snacks like cheese, fruits, and vegetables</li>
      <li>Avoid sticky candies and frequent snacking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preschool Years (3-5 years)</h2>
    
    <h3>Building Independence</h3>
    <p>Children can start taking more responsibility:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Increase toothpaste:</strong> Use a pea-sized amount</li>
      <li><strong>Teach proper technique:</strong> Show them how to brush all surfaces</li>
      <li><strong>Introduce flossing:</strong> Start when teeth touch each other</li>
      <li><strong>Regular dental visits:</strong> Every 6 months for checkups</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Concerns</h3>

    </ul>

    <h2>School Age (6-12 years)</h2>
    
    <h3>Permanent Teeth Arrival</h3>
    <p>The transition to permanent teeth brings new considerations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First molars:</strong> Usually appear around age 6</li>

      <li><strong>Orthodontic evaluation:</strong> Around age 7</li>

    <h2>Teenage Years (13+ years)</h2>

      <li><strong>Sports injuries:</strong> Higher risk of dental trauma</li>
      <li><strong>Poor habits:</strong> Irregular brushing, sugary drinks</li>

      <li>Provide quality oral care products</li>
      <li>Regular dental visits for professional guidance</li>

    </ul>
